# profile_remote_control

A new Flutter project. A Practice Flutter app for learning and getting use to.
Has Buttons, Drawer, Tabs, etc basic UI widgets. It has also a remote control ui, but doesnt do anything right now except moving a red circle to test if it works. I use joystick plugin for that.
